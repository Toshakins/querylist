Installation
============

Querylist can be installed like any other python package::

    $ pip install querylist

Once installed, both QueryList and BetterDict can be imported directly from
the querylist module.

    >>> from querylist import BetterDict, QueryList

QueryList is currently only tested against Python 2.6 and 2.7, though it
should work in 2.5 as well.
