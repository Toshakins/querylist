Installation
============

You can install querylist like you'd install any other python package::

    $ pip install querylist

Once installed, you can import both QueryList and BetterDict directly from
the querylist module and use them to your heart's content.

    >>> from querylist import BetterDict, QueryList

QueryList is currently only tested against Python 2.6 and 2.7, though it
should work in 2.5 as well.
